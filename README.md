Handwritten Digit Recognition
Introduction
This project is aimed at developing a handwritten digit recognition system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) based on images of handwritten digits.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is the MNIST dataset, which is a widely-used benchmark dataset for handwritten digit recognition. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each of size 28x28 pixels.

Model
The model architecture used for this project is a convolutional neural network (CNN). CNNs have shown excellent performance in image classification tasks, making them suitable for handwritten digit recognition. The architecture comprises multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and fully connected layers, culminating in a softmax output layer for class probabilities.

Implementation
The project is implemented in Python using the TensorFlow framework. TensorFlow provides robust support for building and training deep learning models, making it an ideal choice for this project. The code is organized into several modules:

Data Preparation: This module is responsible for loading the MNIST dataset, preprocessing the images, and splitting them into training and testing sets.

Model Definition: Here, the CNN model architecture is defined using TensorFlow's high-level APIs such as Keras. The architecture includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

Training: The training module trains the CNN model on the training dataset. It involves feeding batches of images to the model, computing the loss, and optimizing the model parameters using gradient descent.

Evaluation: This module evaluates the trained model's performance on the testing dataset. It computes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's effectiveness in classifying handwritten digits.

Deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed for real-world usage. This module provides functions to load the trained model and classify handwritten digits from user-provided images.
